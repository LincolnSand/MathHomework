\textbf{H1.}

\textbf{128.19}:

Consider an ellipse with the equation $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$,
where $a$ is the major axis and $b$ is the semi-minor axis. The foci
are at $(c, 0)$ and $(-c, 0)$, where $c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$.

Let $P(x, y)$ be a point on the ellipse. We want to prove that the sum of squares of the distance
from $P$ to the foci is constant and always equal to $2 a^2$.

Distance from $P$ to the first focus:
The distance $P F_1$ is given by $P F_1 = \sqrt{(x-c)^2 + y^2}$.

Distance from $P$ to the second focus:
The distance $P F_2$ is given by $P F_2 = \sqrt{(x+c)^2 + y^2}$.

We need to prove that $P F_1^2 + P F_2^2$ is constant for any point on the ellipse.
\[P F_1^2 = (x-c)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 2 c x + c^2 + y^2\]
\[P F_2^2 = (x+c)^2 + y^2 = x^2 + 2 c x + c^2 + y^2\]

\[P F_1^2 + P F_2^2 = 2 x^2 + 2 c^2 + 2 y^2\]
Since $P$ lies on the ellipse, substituting $y^2 = b^2 - \frac{b^2}{a^2} x^2$ gives:
\[P F_1^2 + P F_2^2 = 2 x^2 + 2 c^2 + 2 b^2 - \frac{2 b^2}{a^2} x^2\]
\[P F_1^2 + P F_2^2 = 2 a^2 + 2 c^2 - 2 c^2\]
\[P F_1^2 + P F_2^2 = 2 a^2\]

\textbf{128.26}:

We can rewrite the given equation as:
\[y^2 = p x - \frac{p}{2a} x^2\]
This can be written in standard form
where $b^2 = \frac{p}{2a}$.

We will prove in the following order:

1. $N P$ is perpendicular to the axis of the ellipse.

2. $P G$ is the minimum distance from $G$ to the curve.

3. $P G$ is perpendicular to the tangent at $P$.

1. By construction, $N P$ is drawn perpendicular to the major axis
$A A'$. Any line perpendicular to the major axis
and passing through a point must also pass through the corresponding
point on the ellipse. This is true by the reflective property of ellipses.

2. For $P G$ to be the minimum distance from $G$ to the ellipse,
it must be perpendicular to the curve at $P$. In an ellipse,
the shortest distance from a point outside the ellipse to the ellipse
itself is along the line that passes through the nearest focus.
Since $N P$ is perpendicular to the major axis and intersects the ellipse at $P$,
it implies that $N P$ is the shortest distance from $N$ to the ellipse,
and hence $P G$ must be the shortest distance from $G$ to the ellipse.

3. Given $y^2 = x(p - \frac{p}{2a} x)$, let's differentiate this with respect to $x$
to find the slope of the tangent line.

We get:
\[2y \frac{dy}{dx} = p - \frac{p}{a} x\]
\[\implies \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{p-\frac{p}{a}x}{2y}\]

At point $P$, the line $N P$ is vertical, so $x$ is a constant and $y$ varies.
Since $N P$ is perpendicular to the major axis $A A'$, it is also the normal
to the ellipse at point $P$. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at $P$
must be horizontal, which means $\frac{dy}{dx}$ at $P$ must be $0$.

\textbf{168.1}:

We will use the formula:
\[crd\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)^2 = R^2 - \left(\frac{crd(\theta)}{2}\right)^2\]

\[crd(30^\circ)^2 = R^2 - \left(\frac{crd(60^\circ)}{2}\right)^2\]
\[\implies crd(30^\circ) = \sqrt{R^2 - \left(\frac{R}{2}\right)^2}\]
\[\implies crd(30^\circ) = \frac{R \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{60 \sqrt{3}}{2}\]

Using the same forumula, 
We get:
\[crd(15^\circ) = \sqrt{60^2 - \left(\frac{crd(30^\circ)}{2}\right)^2}\]
\[crd(7.5^\circ) = \sqrt{60^2 - \left(\frac{crd(15^\circ)}{2}\right)^2}\]

\textbf{168.4}:

Let's consider a cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ inscribed in a circle, where:
\[\angle ADB = 180^\circ - \alpha\]
\[\angle BDC = 180^\circ - \beta\]
\[\angle ADC = 180^\circ - (\alpha + \beta)\]

The sides $AD$ and $BC$ are not adjacent and thus will form the diagonals
of the quadrilateral when connected. The other sides are $AB$, $CD$, $BD$, and $AC$.

Now, according to Ptolemy's theorem:
\[AD \cdot BC + AB \cdot CD = AC \cdot BD\]

In terms of chord lengths in a circle of radius $R$, where $R = 60$
to fit the ancient Greek chord system, we can express the sides as follows:
\[AD = crd(180^\circ - \alpha)\]
\[BC = crd(180^\circ - \beta)\]
\[AB = crd(\beta)\]
\[CD = crd(\alpha)\]
\[AC = crd(180^\circ - (\alpha + \beta))\]
\[BC = crd(\alpha + \beta)\]

Substituting this into Ptolemy's theorem gives us:
\[crd(180^\circ - \alpha) \cdot crd(180^\circ - \beta) + crd(\alpha) \cdot crd(\beta)\]
\[= crd(180^\circ - (\alpha + \beta)) \cdot crd(\alpha + \beta)\]

We need to prove that:
\[120 \cdot crd(180^\circ - (\alpha + \beta))\]
\[= crd(180^\circ - \alpha) \cdot crd(180^\circ - \beta) - crd(\alpha) \cdot crd(\beta)\]

To align this with the equation derived from Ptolemy's theorem, we need
to consider the property of chord lenghts where $crd(\theta) = crd(360^\circ - \theta)$.
This implies that $crd(\alpha + \beta) = crd(180^\circ - (\alpha + \beta))$ in a semicircle.

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[crd(180^\circ - \alpha) \cdot crd(180^\circ - \beta) + crd(\alpha) \cdot crd(\beta)\]
\[= crd(180^\circ - (\alpha + \beta)) \cdot crd(180^\circ - (\alpha + \beta))\]

Rearranging and multiplying both sides by $120$ gives:
\[120 \cdot [crd(180^\circ - \alpha) \cdot crd(180^\circ - \beta) - crd(\alpha) \cdot crd(\beta)]\]
\[= 120 \cdot [crd(180^\circ - (\alpha + \beta)^2)]\]

This equation demonstrates the sum formula.

\textbf{168.22}:

First, let's confirm this is a valid triangle.
The sum of any two sides should be larger than the third side.

\[4 + 7 > 10\]
\[4 + 10 > 7\]
\[7 + 10 > 4\]

Method 1: Heron's formula

\[A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\]

where $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$.

For our triangle,
$s = \frac{21}{2} = 10.5$

\[A = \sqrt{10.5(10.5 - 4)(10.5 - 7)(10.5 - 10)}\]

Method 2: Heron's alternative formula

\[A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(a+b+c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)}\]

\[A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{(4+7+10)(-4+7+10)(4-7+10)(4+7-10)}\]

Both methods give approximately $10.93$ square units.
